GitHub Copilot: Write a complete protocol documentation for a UDP-based client-server time application written in C++.

Include:
- Project overview
- List of supported message types (GetTime, MeasureRTT, etc.)
- For each message:
  - What the client sends
  - What the server responds with
  - The response format (e.g. HH:MM:SS)
- Explanation of the message structure (binary or text format, codes)
- Example request/response pairs
- Reference to screenshots from Wireshark (stored in /docs/screenshots/)
- Summary of the protocol's simplicity and limitations

Format it as professional Markdown with clear headers.
